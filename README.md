# myAgent

# Usage
## Intro
This project is meant to be a stand-up API that holds functionalities of the spotify on the web so I can perform functions from my phone. 

## Setup (Dev)
It's a docker container so its pretty easy to use. Navigate to the myProject folder and run `docker-compose up`. It will spin up on localhost:5001 and the functions can be reached at /api/v1/`function_name`. Functions are defined in `myApp/api/views.py`.
